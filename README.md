# Micropython Examples for ESP32 "Cheap Yellow Display"
This is display and touch screen boilerplate to use with Micropython on the ["CYD"](https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display).

Flash the CYD with Micropython ESP32 Generic.
I suggest using the most current release.

Upload the files to your board using Thonny, rshell or whatever IDE extension that can talk to the board.

Reboot and try it out. Your touch screen may not report the same values, so will need altering.
